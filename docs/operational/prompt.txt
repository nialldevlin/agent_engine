You are operating in Cline PLAN mode. Your goal is to verify, update, and
strengthen the Phase 2 Implementation Plan for Agent Engine.

FIRST: Read and analyze all context files:

Context:
@/docs/operational/PHASE_2_SCHEMAS_OVERVIEW.md
@/docs/operational/PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
@/docs/canonical/AGENT_ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md
@/docs/canonical/AGENT_ENGINE_SPEC.md

Task:
1. Compare the content of PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md against:
   - PHASE_2_SCHEMAS_OVERVIEW.md,
   - AGENT_ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md,
   - The current state of code files referenced in the section
     "## 2. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS" of PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

2. Determine whether the implementation plan:
   - Accurately reflects the requirements for Phase 2.
   - Is complete and correct according to the canonical docs.
   - Is ready for execution by Qwen2.5-Coder-7B.

3. If the plan IS complete and correct:
   - Output a SHORT STATUS BRIEF summarizing:
     - What is complete,
     - What Phase 2 covers,
     - Confirmation that the plan is ready for Qwen.

4. If the plan is NOT complete or needs updates:
   - Output a SHORT STATUS BRIEF explaining what is missing or inconsistent.
   - THEN output a fully rewritten PHASED IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF (NOT a diff)
     structured as follows:

     === UPDATED PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF ===

     ## Phase Summary
     - Objective, constraints, success criteria.

     ## Phase Structure
     Break Phase 2 into clear sequential phases, such as:

       Phase 2.1 — Schema Registry Verification/Completion  
       Phase 2.2 — Manifest Loader + Validation Completion  
       Phase 2.3 — Cross-Manifest Integrity Requirements  
       Phase 2.4 — Task Persistence & Resumability Implementation

     Each phase must include:
       - Goals
       - Exact files involved
       - Exact functions/classes to create or modify
       - Invariants to preserve
       - Edge cases to handle

     ## Sequential Qwen Prompts (Act Mode)
     Create a numbered list of HIGH-QUALITY Qwen prompts.
     Each prompt must:

       - Reference exact files
       - Specify allowed edits
       - Specify forbidden actions
       - Request unified diffs for file edits
       - Target one small step per prompt (1–2 files per step)
       - Follow a dependency-safe order (no steps out of sequence)

     These prompts must be ready to paste directly into Cline Act Mode.

     ## Requirements & Validation Checklist
     - List every invariant, constraint, and cross-manifest rule that must remain correct.

     ## Final Notes for Implementation
     - Anything Qwen must pay special attention to.
     - Risks, pitfalls, clarity notes.

Your job:
Produce either:
(a) a SHORT STATUS BRIEF confirming readiness, OR  
(b) a FULL UPDATED IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF with phases + Qwen prompt list.
