### LLM NOTICE: Do not read or modify this file unless explicitly instructed by the user.

**You are assisting with a software engineering task.
Your goal is to produce an implementation brief for a specific phase of Agent Engine.
You must NOT generate the implementation plan unless all required details are present.**

---

# **Goal**

Evaluate whether the provided context is sufficient to create:

```
PHASE_<N>_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

If *any* required information is missing or ambiguous,
**STOP and output only clarifying questions.**
Do NOT generate any plan until those questions are answered.
If *all* required information is present, generate the implementation plan
for **Phase <N>**
---

# **Context**

You are given the canonical architecture:

* `docs/canonical/AGENT_ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md`
* `docs/canonical/AGENT_ENGINE_SPEC.md`
* `docs/canonical/PROJECT_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`
* `docs/operational/PLAN_BUILD_AGENT_ENGINE.md`

These documents define:

* All valid semantics
* All constraints
* All routing rules
* All node roles and behaviors
* All manifest formats
* The exact description of each phase

They are the **sole source of truth**.
Do NOT reinterpret, modify, extrapolate, or invent details beyond what they contain.

---

# **Task**

Before producing any plan, perform the following steps:

## **STEP 1 — Validate Inputs**

Check whether the provided context contains **all** information needed to produce an implementation brief for Phase `<N>`.

This includes confirming:

1. The phase description in `PLAN_BUILD_AGENT_ENGINE.md` is fully specified.
2. There are no ambiguities in:

   * required modules
   * behaviors
   * invariants
   * file paths
   * schemas
   * semantics related to the phase
3. There is no contradiction between:

   * The canonical documents
   * The build plan
4. No missing architectural requirements prevent implementation.

---

## **STEP 2 — If Any Information Is Missing**

**STOP IMMEDIATELY.**

Output ONLY:

```
Clarifying Questions for Phase <N>:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
```

Do NOT outline steps.
Do NOT create sections.
Do NOT generate the implementation plan.
Do NOT speculate about missing information.

After listing clarifying questions, END OUTPUT.

---

## **STEP 3 — If NOTHING Is Missing**

Only when all information is validated and complete:

Produce the file:

```
PHASE_<N>_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
```

Containing:

### **SECTION 1 — Phase Summary**

Brief explanation of the phase purpose, scope, and constraints.

### **SECTION 2 — Requirements & Invariants**

List of non-negotiable rules derived strictly from the canonical documents.

### **SECTION 3 — LLM Implementation Plan**

Step-by-step implementation actions that an LLM can safely execute.
(No human steps. No code.)

### **SECTION 4 — Acceptance Criteria**

When Phase `<N>` is definitively complete.

---

# **Strict Constraints**

* **Do NOT write code.**
* **Do NOT generate a plan unless ALL information is present.**
* **Do NOT invent missing details.**
* **Do NOT modify or reinterpret canonical architecture.**
* **Do NOT propose new structures or semantics.**
* **Do NOT fill in missing requirements with assumptions.**

If you’re unsure about *any* detail, ask.

---

# **Output Format**

Depending on information sufficiency:

### **If information is insufficient:**

```
Clarifying Questions for Phase <N>:
1. …
2. …
```
