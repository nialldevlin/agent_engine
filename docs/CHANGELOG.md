# Changelog

## 2025-12-03
- Added documentation rules and cleaned obsolete operational archives to reduce maintenance overhead.

- Closed PLAN_CODEX after completion (see repo history for details) and removed outdated GETTING_STARTED and architecture pointer docs to prevent stale guidance.
- Replaced legacy knight roles with neutral agent manifests, removed ContextStore fallback, and quarantined the King Arthur lift under `legacy/king_arthur/`.
